The `xiaomi` vacuum platform allows you to control the state of your [Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum](http://www.mi.com/roomrobot/).

Current supported features are `turn_on`, `pause`, `stop`, `return_to_home`, `turn_off` (stops goes to dock), `locate`, `clean_spot`, `set_fanspeed` and even remote control your robot.

## {% linkable_title Getting started %}

Follow the pairing process using your phone and Mi-Home app. From here you will be able to retrieve the token from a SQLite file inside your phone.

Before you begin you need to install libffi-dev by running the command below. This is needed for python-mirobi to be installed correctly. 
```bash
$ apt-get install libffi-dev
```

<p class='note warning'>
If your Home Assistant installation is running in a [Virtualenv](/docs/installation/virtualenv/#upgrading-home-assistant), make sure you activate it by running the commands below.</p>

```bash
$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
```

In order to fetch the token follow these instructions depending on your mobile phone platform.

### Windows and Android
1. Configure the robot with the Mi-Home app.
2. Enable developer mode and USB debugging on the Android phone and plug it into the computer.
3. Get ADB tool for Windows : https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
4. Create a backup of the application com.xiaomi.smarthome:
```bash
.\adb backup -noapk com.xiaomi.smarthome -f backup.ab
```
5. If you have this message : "More than one device or emulator", use this command to list all devices:
```bash
.\adb devices
```
and execute this command:
```bash
.\adb -s DEVICEID backup -noapk com.xiaomi.smarthome -f backup.ab # (with DEVICEID the device id from the previous command)
```
6. On the phone, you must confirm the backup. DO NOT enter any password and press button to make the backup.
7. Get ADB Backup Extractor : https://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/
8. Extract All files from the backup:
```bash
java.exe -jar ../android-backup-extractor/abe.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar ""
```
9. Unzip the ".tar" file.
10. Open the sqlite DB miio2.db with a tool like SQLite Manager extension for FireFox.
11. Get token from "devicerecord" table.


### macOS and iOS
1. Setup iOS device with the Mi-Home app.
2. Create an unencrypted backup of the device using iTunes.
3. Install iBackup Viewer from here: http://www.imactools.com/iphonebackupviewer/
4. Extract this file /raw data/com.xiami.mihome/_mihome.sqlite to your computer
5. Open the file extracted using notepad. You will then see the list of all the device in your account with their token.

### {% linkable_title Platform services %}

In addition to all [`vacuum` component services](/components/vacuum#component-services) (`turn_on`, `turn_off`, `start_pause`, `stop`, `return_to_home`, `locate`, `set_fanspeed` and `send_command`), the `xiaomi` platform introduces specific services to access the remote control mode of the botvac.
